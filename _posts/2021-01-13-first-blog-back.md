Welcome to my blog! I have written a lot of "starting today, I will blog more regularly again" posts that turned out to be false promises, so I will not go quite all the way there. Still, with the rebuilding of my personal website it seemed only right to have a writing section, and rather than dive right in it feels more polite to acknowledge where all this comes from.

You can learn more about me [on this site](/) of course; and I have written a lot of things over the years. This will be a place to drop casual thoughts about video games and other topics, if they show up.

So, welcome! Thanks for coming by.
