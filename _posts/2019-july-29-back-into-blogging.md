I spent the last week or so working through various things for the autumn ahead, and one of the biggest things I've missed in the last few months has been blogging. It's easy to let it go of course, but one of the challenges sometimes is **what** do I talk about anyway?

You write about what you know, and if you know nothing you can still blog; it seems a likely enough rule. This week I tried, again, to start using github as a "humanist" of the digital variety. I'm not sure if I'm a digital humanist, though I know I'm not a humanist. I am human, and I believe in digital things and especially digital tools -  but then again I tend to see people describe themselves as such and such in the Digital Humanities. Well. Usually it's more descriptive.

I'm not sure where I am on introducing code into anything just yet but this does seem like a good home for my [History Bots](http://profjohnharney.github.io/historybots) class. Spiritually so, if nothing else.
